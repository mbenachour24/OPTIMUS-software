Optimus: Rule of Law Backend System
--

Optimus is a computational model designed to simulate the institutional logic of the State and the Rule of Law. This project builds on the principles of systems theory, legal philosophy, and agent-based modeling (ABM) to demonstrate how political and judicial systems interact while maintaining coherence through structured decision-making.

This repository includes:
	â€¢	A Flask backend to manage state progression and interactions between the political and judicial systems.
	â€¢	A dynamic day progression system, ensuring both systems complete their tasks before advancing to the next day.
	â€¢	Fully integrated HTML frontends for the political and judicial systems.

Project Highlights

1. Key Features
	â€¢	Day Progression Logic: Days only advance when both systems have completed their actions, mirroring decision-based games like Werewolf (Loup-Garou).
	â€¢	Political System:
	â€¢	Create norms (laws).
	â€¢	Send norms to the judicial system for review.
	â€¢	Judicial System:
	â€¢	Mark norms as unconstitutional.
	â€¢	Provide feedback to the political system.
	â€¢	Dynamic Notifications and Logs: Real-time updates on actions taken by each system.

3. The Four Rules of the Optimus Method

This project adheres to Mohamed Ben Achourâ€™s Optimus Framework:
	1.	Functional Differentiation: Political and judicial systems operate autonomously with their own logic.
	2.	Autopoiesis: Each system self-regulates based on binary distinctions (valid/invalid, constitutional/unconstitutional).
	3.	Structural Coupling: Systems interact through stable, interdependent feedback loops.
	4.	Societal Orchestration: A central orchestrator (Flask backend) manages iterations and ensures proper synchronization.

3. Architecture
	â€¢	Backend: Flask
	â€¢	Frontend: HTML/CSS (basic UI for Political and Judicial systems)
	â€¢	Simulation: Agent-based model with Python classes for norms, cases, and systems.
	â€¢	State Management: Simple in-memory tracking for day progression and completed actions.

How to Run
--

1. Clone the Repository

	git clone https://github.com/mbenachour24/OPTIMUS-software.git
	cd OPTIMUS-software/Backend

2. Set Up the Environment

	Install Python dependencies:
	
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask App

	python app.py

4. Access the Interfaces
	â€¢	Political System: http://127.0.0.1:5000/political
	â€¢	Judicial System: http://127.0.0.1:5000/judicial

How It Works
--

Day Progression
	1.	The political system creates a norm.
	2.	The judicial system evaluates the norm:
	â€¢	Marks it as constitutional/unconstitutional.
	â€¢	Sends feedback to the political system.
	3.	Once both systems have completed their actions, the day progresses.

Endpoints

Backend API
	â€¢	/api/create_norm - Creates a new norm (Political System).
	â€¢	/api/check_constitutionality - Marks a norm as constitutional/unconstitutional (Judicial System).
	â€¢	/api/simulate_day - Advances the day when both systems have completed actions.
	â€¢	/api/get_norms - Retrieves all norms created so far.
	â€¢	/api/get_cases - Retrieves all cases reviewed by the judicial system.

Frontend Pages
	â€¢	Political System: Allows users to create norms and review feedback.
	â€¢	Judicial System: Allows users to evaluate norms and send notifications.

Future Improvements
	â€¢	Expand the society orchestration to simulate more complex systems and feedback loops.
	â€¢	Add user authentication for role-based access (e.g., Political or Judicial actors).
	â€¢	Implement persistent state storage (e.g., database) for norms and cases.
	â€¢	Introduce more dynamic frontends with ReactJS or similar frameworks.
